<h2>Relation files</h2>
<p>
Relation files describe binary relations over one type of entity, e.g. over users or over items.
An example for a user relation is the edges in the social network.
An example for an item relation would be the relation "A is a sequel to B" for movies.
</p>
<p>
Please note that relations are not automatically symmetric.
This means that "1,2" does not imply "2,1".
If you want to have a symmetric relation, make sure that both lines are contained in the file.
</p>
Relation files have exactly two columns. Each column contains an entity ID.
One line in a file means there exists a relation between the first and the second entity mentioned in that line.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Tab-separated columns (.tsv)</h3>
<pre>
51    5
51    22
51    26
51    29
51    35
51    36
51    45
</pre>
This means that the entity 51 (may be a user or item) is in relation with the entities 5, 22, 26, ... of the same type
If this example is complete, it also means entity 51 does not have a relation with entities 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, ...

<h3>Space-separated columns</h3>
<pre>
51 5
51 22
51 26
51 29
51 35
51 36
51 45
</pre>

<h3>Comma-separated columns (.csv)</h3>
<pre>
51,5
51,22
51,26
51,29
51,35
51,36
51,45
</pre>

<h2>Command-line tools</h2>
<p>
Both the <a href="item_prediction.html">item recommendation tool</a> and the <a href="rating_prediction.html">rating prediction tool</a>
support this file format.
</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
The class for reading in this kind of file is
<code><a href="https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite/blob/master/src/MyMediaLite/IO/RelationData.cs">
MyMediaLite.IO.RelationData</a></code>.
</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
Writing this file format is trivial, so there is no specific class for that in MyMediaLite.


<h2>Future Work</h2>
In the future, we plan to extend relation support in MyMediaLite.
Feel free to leave a comment on <a href="https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite/issues/37">issue #37 on MyMediaLite's github tracker</a> if you have specific requirements or ideas.
